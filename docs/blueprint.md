# **App Name**: Node Keeper

## Core Features:

- Node setup: Setup 3 nodes in a distributed key-value storage system.
- Key-value partitioning: Each node stores a portion of the overall key-value database.
- Client interface: The client application PUTs(key, value), GETs(key), and DELETEs(key).
- Request routing: Client connects to any node, which forwards the request if necessary.
- Node communication: Nodes communicate via gRPC.
- Data Replication: Implement data replication for fault tolerance with at least two copies on different nodes.
- Fault Tolerance and Recovery: Handle node failures, detect failures using heartbeats, and recover data from other nodes using snapshots.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#3F51B5) for a sense of stability and authority.
- Background color: Very light blue-gray (#F0F4F8) to create a subtle, neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Amber (#FFC107) as a contrasting highlight color for key interactive elements. Amber will create a clear visual signal, because its hue differs considerably from the blues, while still harmonizing thanks to the shared undertones of warmth.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern and readable interface.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use minimalist, outline-style icons for a clean and modern look.
- Maintain a clean and structured layout with clear separation between elements.
